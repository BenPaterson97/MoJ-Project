# Task Manager App
This is my 'Task Manager' application for the MoJ technical test. This application is a simple server and client that adds and deletes tasks from a database. It also includes a set of integration tests for the different API calls.

Backend - NodeJS
Database - PostgreSQL
Frontend - ReactJS

## How to use:
Install the libraries in the server and client folders separately.
Start the backend by 'npm start' in the server folder.
Load the webpage by 'npm start' in the client folder.
