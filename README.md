# Task Manager App
This is my 'Task Manager' application for the MoJ technical test. This application is a simple server and client that adds and deletes tasks from a database. It also includes a set of integration tests for the different API calls.

### Technology Overview:
Backend - NodeJS
Database - PostgreSQL
Frontend - ReactJS

### How to use:
Install the libraries in the server and client folders separately.
Start the backend by 'npm start' in the server folder.
Load the webpage by 'npm start' in the client folder.

### Known Issues and Limitations:
Currently, there are no frontend unit tests. This is because I encounted some issues with their implementation.

### Next Steps:
Given more time, I would first implement the unit tests, then I would look to further increase the actions that the user can take. Examples would include: the ability to edit tasks directly; or, to filter tasks by status/assignee.
